# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to GitLab Watchman. I'm always looking for more contributions towards the project.

The two main areas where you can contribute are:
- Signature files
- Additional functionality


## Adding new signatures
GitLab Watchman runs using YAML signature files that are stored in the `signature` directory. They define what to search Slack for, and are the heart of the application.

Instructions on how to create your own signature files can be found in `docs\signatures.md`

If you do write your own signatures, please contribute them to the project by creating a pull request.


## Additional functionality
You can make recommendations for new functionality via raising issues using the feature request template. Even better, you could contribute the additional functionality yourself and create a pull request for the changes to be added to a future release.

## Style

GitLab Watchman follows Google style guidelines mostly, but the main thing is to stay consistent to the style already in use.

## Documentation
Currently, documentation and additional resources are kept on [my blog](https://papermtn.co.uk/category/tools/gitlab-watchman/)
